#### Project Background ####
Escape from Tarkov is a multiplayer first-person loot and shooter in development by Battlestate Games. Items obtained in-game can be put up for sale to other players for varying prices. The objective of the app is to be able to quickly search market prices for items whist in-game.

#### Project Future ####
Currently the project is depreciated, as university studies are more important, and i have lost some interest in the game. If i ever came back to the game, this project may be revived.

#### Languages / Interfaces ####
C++, Qt Framework, curl 7.74.0, rapidjson, tarkov-market (paid api)
